This mini-project demonstrates a basic implementation of pagination. It allows users to navigate through a large dataset by dividing it into smaller, manageable chunks.

## Features

- Chunk of products: Displays chunks of products which increases the overall loadtime and gives optimal exprience.

- navigation: Navigate between pages to load more products data.

## Setup

- Install Dependencies (npm install).

- If using a backend, ensure Node.js is installed and run the server script.
